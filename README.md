    I originally studied engineering at university and during that time I started getting involved in several cybersecurity events such as Capture the Flag activities and conferences. As I became more experienced, I found that I enjoyed the challenges of cybersecurity more than my degree.

I loved that thinking unconventionally was encouraged, for example, identifying the exceptions, finding the anomalies, or thinking of things no one has ever considered before. This made learning about techniques and tools exciting.

I had found a possible career that I enjoyed, one that helped keep the world safe.

      In my current role, everything is always new, and things progress quickly. The feeling of continuous development is highly rewarding.

      The drawback of rapid growth and expansion is a lack of hours in the working week to keep up with everything! Balancing continuous learning with a constantly evolving role can be a real challenge.

      In 5 years, I plan to be an executive within the Security Services part of our business. In that role, I’ll be able to help make our organization the most effective in Europe and further afield.

      Over the last few years, I’ve learnt to consider problems with a view to a larger context. When starting in a security role, obviously good ideas and obviously bad ideas are easy to separate. As you start to consider regulatory requirements, business requirements, and other external factors, even seemingly simple problems can have some nuance.

      The first consideration is to find an area you are passionate about and build from there. Find some journals, blogs, podcasts, or other resources relevant to that area and keep learning more.

The second consideration is to start pulling apart technologies and understanding their quirks. Once you’ve learnt the basics about networking or compiling code, try thinking about what the edge cases are. Can you break something? How can it go wrong? This inquisitive nature will help drive your development.
